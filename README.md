# Type Error in TypeScript Function
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript functions. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but in the usage, a string is passed as an argument.  This leads to a type error during compilation.

The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly type check the function parameters to prevent such errors.
